Heart Disease: Overview and Common Conditions

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It occurs when the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of cholesterol and other materials (plaque) on their inner walls. This process is called atherosclerosis.

Symptoms of CAD include:
- Chest pain or discomfort (angina)
- Shortness of breath
- Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen, or back
- Fatigue

Risk Factors:
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Smoking
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity
- Family history of heart disease
- Age (risk increases with age)

Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)
A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked for a long enough time that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. This is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries.

Warning Signs:
- Chest pain or pressure
- Pain spreading to shoulders, arms, neck, or jaw
- Lightheadedness or dizziness
- Sweating
- Nausea or vomiting
- Shortness of breath

Emergency Response:
If you suspect a heart attack, call emergency services immediately. Time is critical - the sooner treatment begins, the better the chances of survival and reduced heart damage.

Heart Failure
Heart failure doesn't mean the heart has stopped working. It means the heart isn't pumping blood as well as it should. The body may not get enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly.

Types of Heart Failure:
1. Left-sided heart failure: Most common type, affecting the left ventricle
2. Right-sided heart failure: Affects the right ventricle
3. Congestive heart failure: Fluid buildup in the lungs and other organs

Symptoms:
- Shortness of breath during activity or when lying down
- Fatigue and weakness
- Swelling in legs, ankles, and feet
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- Reduced ability to exercise
- Persistent cough or wheezing
- Sudden weight gain from fluid retention

Arrhythmias
Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.

Common Types:
- Atrial fibrillation (AFib): Most common type, irregular heartbeat
- Bradycardia: Heart rate too slow (less than 60 beats per minute)
- Tachycardia: Heart rate too fast (more than 100 beats per minute)
- Premature contractions: Extra heartbeats

Prevention and Management

Lifestyle Changes:
- Eat a heart-healthy diet (low in saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium)
- Exercise regularly (at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity)
- Maintain a healthy weight
- Quit smoking
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Manage stress
- Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)

Medical Management:
- Take medications as prescribed
- Monitor blood pressure regularly
- Control cholesterol levels
- Manage diabetes if present
- Regular check-ups with healthcare provider

Diet Recommendations:
- Fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins (fish, poultry, legumes)
- Low-fat dairy products
- Healthy fats (olive oil, avocados, nuts)
- Limit sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day
- Reduce added sugars

When to See a Doctor:
- New or worsening chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Irregular heartbeat
- Swelling in legs or abdomen
- Unexplained fatigue
- Dizziness or fainting

Regular Health Screenings:
- Blood pressure check: At least once every 2 years
- Cholesterol check: Every 4-6 years (more often if at risk)
- Diabetes screening: Every 3 years starting at age 45
- Weight and BMI: At each doctor's visit

Remember: Early detection and treatment of heart disease can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life. Always consult with Dr. Ahmed or another qualified cardiologist for personalized medical advice.
